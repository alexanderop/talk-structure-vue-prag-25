# Modular Monolith

Group by **feature folders** inside one repo.  
Important: a monorepo ≠ monolith.  

**Trade-offs**  
✅ Strong feature boundaries  
✅ Easier refactoring & scaling  
✅ Works well with path aliases  
❌ Configuration overhead (tooling, CI)  
❌ Deployment is unified (less flexibility)
