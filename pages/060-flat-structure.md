# Flat Structure

Files grouped by type (components, utils, composables).  
Feels like a monolith — but when scoped per business subdomain, it gives **clarity** and even **AI indexing benefits**.

**Trade-offs**  
✅ Simple, fast to start  
✅ Easy onboarding  
❌ Long imports (fixed with TS path aliases)  
❌ Harder boundaries between features
